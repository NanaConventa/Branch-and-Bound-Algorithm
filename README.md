# Branch-and-Bound-Algorithm
Desktop application created to adapt branch and bound algorithm for the travelling salesman problem. Application displays complete binary tree.

The implemented program displays a decision tree, which is generated along with the execution of the algorithm. 
By running the PRAPIO, user can learn about Branch and Bound Algorithm and check his calculations as every move of algorithm is displayed on the screen. 
The work contains an analysis of the usability of the branch and bound algorithm depending on various input data. 
The application is written in Java in the Intellij Idea environment, 
and its graphic interface was programmed using the JavaFX graphics library.
